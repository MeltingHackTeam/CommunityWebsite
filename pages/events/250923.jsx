                                    <h4>Event Report</h4>
                                    <p>You read that right. <strong>MeltingHack</strong>, the international hackathon community born and raised in Tokyo, just packed its bags and hosted its very first booth. And for our big debut, we decided to skip town. Not just to another city in Japan, but all the way to <strong>Shanghai for S-Tron Shanghai 2025</strong>!</p>
                                    <p>Honestly, this leap across the sea wouldn&apos;t have even been a dream without the incredible support of <strong>Whiplus from IVS</strong>. He helped turn our &quot;what if?&quot; into a reality, and we are endlessly grateful.</p>
                                    <p>For the past year and a half, we&apos;ve been pouring our hearts into building MeltingHack in Tokyo, running hackathons with amazing companies and creating a space where challengers can get their hands dirty with practical, real-world learning. We&apos;ve been heads-down, focused on our local community. So, taking our show on the road to one of Asia&apos;s biggest tech events—a gathering of over <strong>13,000 innovators, investors, and tech fanatics</strong>—was a massive step. And wow, was it an experience.</p>

                                    <h4>Shanghai Energy, Human Connections</h4>
                                    <p>The moment we stepped into the West Bund Art Center, the energy was electric. The theme was <strong>&quot;Ignite the Future&quot;</strong>, and you could feel that spark in every conversation. But the real story wasn&apos;t just about the scale; it was about the people.</p>
                                    <p>Our booth was constantly buzzing. In Shanghai, people don&apos;t just walk by; they dive in. We had some of the most intense, passionate discussions about technology and community building right there on the spot. The stereotype of <strong>&quot;Shanghai speed&quot;</strong> is real, but not in a transactional way. People are incredibly action-oriented. We saw deals being discussed and partnerships forming in the blink of an eye.</p>
                                    <p>But what truly blew us away was the <strong>kindness</strong>. The warmth. We met people for the first time who would immediately say, &quot;Oh, you have to meet my friend at this other company,&quot; and make an introduction right then and there. Some people, complete strangers, even offered to help us run the booth when they saw we were busy. It was a powerful reminder that a shared passion for innovation creates an instant bond. We didn&apos;t just feel welcomed; we felt like we were part of a community that genuinely wanted to see each other succeed.</p>

                                    <h4>Gratitude to Our Friends</h4>
                                    <p>A huge part of that feeling came from our friends at <strong>WayToAGI</strong>, China&apos;s largest AI community. They provided an unbelievable amount of support, helping us manage the booth and connect with the right people. Thanks to them and so many others, we left Shanghai not just with a stack of business cards, but with deep, meaningful relationships and a network of true supporters.</p>

                                    <h4>Design That Inspires</h4>
                                    <p>And the inspiration didn&apos;t stop with the people. The design of S-Tron itself was a revelation. The creative, immersive environment was exactly what we strive to create in our own hackathons. Walking through the venue felt like walking through a physical manifestation of our own goals. We left with a notebook full of ideas, completely fired up to level up the MeltingHack experience for our community back home.</p>

                                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                                    <p>S-Tron Shanghai 2025 was more than just our first booth exhibition. It was a stimulating, human, and profoundly inspiring journey. It showed us that our community has a home beyond Tokyo and that the desire to build, connect, and contribute is a universal language. The future has been ignited, indeed.</p>
