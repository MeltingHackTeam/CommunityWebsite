                                    <p>What if you could <strong>build</strong> a fully functional employee in just four hours—not train them, but build them from scratch? That was the challenge at the <strong>AWS AI Agent 1Day Hackathon</strong> in Tokyo. The room was buzzing with some of the city&#39;s sharpest AI engineers. The mission: use AWS&#39;s brand-new <strong>Amazon Bedrock AgentCore</strong> to create a working AI agent before the day was out.</p>
                                    <p>The results weren&#39;t just impressive; they felt like a fast-forward into how teams will work very soon.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div className="py-3">
                                    <h4>The Winner That Stole Everyone&#39;s Heart (and Calendar)</h4>
                                    <p>When the final demos wrapped, one project—<strong>Timey ⌛</strong>—took home first place. It won not only on code quality but on narrative clarity. As the team shared, the biggest lesson of the day was <strong>&quot;Story Telling &gt; Tech Implementation.&quot;</strong></p>
                                    <p>Timey&#39;s story was universal: <strong>time is our most valuable resource</strong>, and attention is how we spend it. Their agent protects that time so you can spend it on what truly matters—family, friends, and personal passions.</p>
                                    <p>So what does it do? <strong>Timey connects to Google Calendar</strong>. Whenever you add an event that requires travel, it <strong>calculates transit time and automatically blocks a buffer</strong> before and after the appointment. No more scrambling with Google Maps and manually creating &quot;Travel to meeting&quot; blocks. It&#39;s a small, elegant fix to a daily frustration. The team—a mix of masterminds and dedicated coders—pushed their demo until the very last second (<em>jikan girigiri</em>) to get it just right.</p>

                                    <h4>An Army of Agents Born in a Day</h4>
                                    <p>Genius didn&#39;t stop with Timey. In only four hours, participants shipped a lineup of surprisingly polished, practical agents—a testament to their skill and to Bedrock AgentCore&#39;s speed.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>AI Magazine Editor</strong>: Scours social media for trends and curates them into a polished, readable magazine.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Slack Translator</strong>: Lives in Slack, instantly translating between Japanese and English for global teams.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Insurance Navigator</strong>: Simplifies international insurance signup by asking plain-language questions and handling paperwork.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Product Hunt Scout</strong>: Monitors Product Hunt to spot breakout products and analyze why they&#39;re winning.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>These weren&#39;t just cool demos—they were <strong>deployable, hireable agents</strong> solving real problems.</p>

                                    <p>This hackathon was more than an event—it was a statement. With powerful frameworks like <strong>Amazon Bedrock AgentCore</strong> and a room full of brilliant minds, the gap between bold ideas and working prototypes is <strong>shrinking fast</strong>. As <strong>Valerio Salvucci</strong>, the mastermind behind the winning project, put it, &quot;The agents are coming 😎.&quot; After seeing what Tokyo&#39;s AI community built in a few hours, we agree. The only question is: <strong>what job will you hire your first AI agent for?</strong></p>
