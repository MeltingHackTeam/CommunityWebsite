                                    <p>55 participants from across Japan joined this exciting event, including 20 university students, 30% women. We were delighted and deeply moved to welcome participants traveling from as far as Hokkaido, Gifu, and Nagoya, making this a truly nationwide event.</p>

                                    <p>The hackathon began on a high note with an inspiring technical session led by an Apple evangelist.</p>
                                    <p>Participants got their first hands-on glimpse of Vision Pro technology, quickly becoming filled with excitement and anticipation upon discovering the remarkable possibilities it unlocks.</p>
                                    <p>We then transitioned into introductions, where each of our special judges and our diverse attendees shared their backgrounds, interests, and ambitions. This naturally sparked conversations that smoothly led into team formation. By the end of Day 1, fourteen innovative teams had already emerged, enthusiastically diving into ideation and networking sessions.</p>

                                    <p>One unique highlight of MeltingHack was the rare opportunity for participants to borrow and use actual Apple Vision Pro devices in their project development. Paired with delicious catering provided during the day, it created an ideal atmosphere for fostering creativity and collaboration.</p>
                                    <p>The name "MeltingHack" was inspired by our hope that participants would become so immersed‚Äîalmost melting away‚Äîdue to excitement and sheer passion. Witnessing everyone's enthusiasm throughout this initial day truly energized and motivated our entire organizing team.</p>
